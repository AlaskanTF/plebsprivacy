This time, two big themes are pulling me in: <strong data-start=\"725\" data-end=\"769\">my journey toward better digital privacy</strong> and <strong data-start=\"774\" data-end=\"799\">my travel experiences</strong>.</p>\n<hr data-start=\"802\" data-end=\"805\">\n<h3 data-start=\"807\" data-end=\"823\">Why privacy?</h3>\n<p data-start=\"825\" data-end=\"1062\">Over the past few years, I’ve become increasingly aware of just how much of my digital life is <strong data-start=\"920\" data-end=\"959\">tracked, monetized, and centralized</strong>. I don’t like it. I want more control, less noise, and fewer middlemen between me and the tools I use.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1064\" data-end=\"1226\">I’ve started taking steps—changing browsers, rethinking my phone, exploring alternative platforms—but it’s a messy process. So I figured: why not journal it here?</p>\n<hr data-start=\"1228\" data-end=\"1231\">\n<h3 data-start=\"1233\" data-end=\"1248\">Why travel?</h3>\n<p data-start=\"1250\" data-end=\"1459\">Travel has always been part of how I reset and reconnect. Whether it’s a short trip out of town or something longer and off-grid, I notice that being in new environments challenges my routines (in a good way).</p>\n<p data-start=\"1461\" data-end=\"1660\">It also brings up new privacy questions:<br data-start=\"1542\" data-end=\"1545\">How do I book without giving up too much info?<br data-start=\"1591\" data-end=\"1594\">How do I take photos and share memories without bleeding metadata?</p>\n<hr data-start=\"1662\" data-end=\"1665\">\n<h3 data-start=\"1667\" data-end=\"1689\">Why write it down?</h3>\n<p data-start=\"1691\" data-end=\"1861\">Because writing helps me commit.<br data-start=\"1723\" data-end=\"1726\">Because someone else might find it useful.<br data-start=\"1768\" data-end=\"1771\">Because I’ve tried (and failed) to make something like this stick before, and that’s okay.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1863\" data-end=\"1951\">Maybe this version is the one that lasts. Or maybe it isn’t. But here it is—<strong data-start=\"1939\" data-end=\"1950\">post #1</strong>.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1953\" data-end=\"1977\">Let’s see where it goes.</p>",
