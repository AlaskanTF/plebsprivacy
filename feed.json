            "content_html": "<h1 id=\"about-me\">About Me</h1>\n<h2 id=\"hey-im-alaskantf-atf\">Hey, I’m AlaskanTF (ATF)!</h2>\n<p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I’m an uncompetitive gamer, tech tinkerer, digital privacy advocate, and occasional wanderer. This site is where I share all the random stuff I’m passionate about: games, gadgets, privacy, and my adventures around the world. If you’re into gaming, tech, travel, or just trying to keep your online life a little safer, you’re in the right place!</p><h2 id=\"why-this-site-exists\">Why This Site Exists</h2>\n<p>I made this site to blend everything I love: gaming, privacy, tech, and travel. Between geeking out over self-hosting projects and exploring new places, I figured why not share it all in one spot? Whether it’s setting up a Tor relay, sharing tips on gaming, or posting about my latest travel escapades, you’ll find it all here.</p><h2 id=\"what-youll-find-here\">What You’ll Find Here</h2>\n<h3 id=\"gaming\">Gaming</h3>\n<p>I’m <strong>uncompetitive</strong> but <strong>hate losing</strong>. It’s all about having fun, but let’s be real: if I’m in a game, I’m giving it my all. Whether you’re looking for tips, fun streams, or just a fellow gamer to chat with, this is where I share my latest gaming adventures. I’ll also toss in some occasional streams and game reviews just for fun.</p><h3 id=\"tech--self-hosting\">Tech &amp; Self-Hosting</h3>\n<p>Tech is my playground. I’m all about <strong>self-hosting</strong>, setting up servers, tinkering with DNS, and even running a <strong>Tor relay</strong> to help with online privacy. I love experimenting with new tools and tech, from building custom PCs to playing with the latest privacy-focused apps. If you’re into tech and want to dive deep into some fun (and sometimes weird) projects, you’ll definitely find that here.</p><h3 id=\"digital-privacy\">Digital Privacy</h3>\n<p>Our data is out there, and it’s being tracked by everyone. That’s why I’m all about digital privacy. I’ll be sharing tips for keeping yourself safe online, reviewing privacy tools, and probably ranting about companies who still don’t respect user security. Privacy isn’t just a feature, it’s a right. Let’s make sure we’re all taking control of our digital footprint.</p><h3 id=\"travel\">Travel</h3>\n<p>When I’m not gaming or messing with tech, I love exploring the world. Traveling is a huge part of my life, and I’ve made it my goal to visit new places, try new things, and document my adventures along the way. Whether I’m wandering through bustling cities, hiking in remote spots, or just soaking in new cultures, I’ll be sharing my travel experiences and tips with you. Expect to find travel stories, photos, and maybe a few recommendations along the way.</p><h2 id=\"a-little-bit-more-about-me\">A Little Bit More About Me</h2>\n<p>When I’m not gaming, traveling, or geeking out over my latest tech project, I’m probably just kicking back and relaxing. I’m not actually from Alaska (I just liked the name), but I picked it because I love 4xx, wide-open spaces, exploration, and a sense of freedom. Whether I’m at home or abroad, I’m always up for a good conversation about tech, travel, privacy, or the best game to play next.</p>",
