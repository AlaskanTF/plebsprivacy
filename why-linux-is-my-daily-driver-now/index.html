The first PC i ever touched was a Compaq Presario running Windows 95 with a 56kbps dial-up connection. I can still hear the sound of the modem connecting like it was yesterday. At that time, the internet was still young as was I. It was a vast uncharted world and the PC was my gateway into it. From internet explorer browsing random sites to flash games to hanging out on telnet BBS (bulletin board system) to simple coding, learning how drivers worked, thinkering with things and some curious hacking (shuting down teacher's PC remotely using CMD, making some "small" changes to the school's website). Those early days sparked a deep curiosity in me about how the systems operated but mainly how they could be manipulated.</p><p>*I'm not that old, I just started young.</p><h2>The Lead Up to Using Linux</h2><p>Fast forward a few years, I started exploring other OSes (Operating Systems) such as Linux and the many distros (Distributions) such as Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu, Arch, PopOS! etc. Since then, I have always had a dual-boot setup, Linux system as my secondary boot as I always fall back to Windows as their GUI (Graphical User Interface) always made things easier and also for better gaming compatibility. However, over the years, Linux has really improved in all departments, from GUI to gaming support (some games even perform better on Linux now).</p><p>As I grew older and followed how the internet and technology has grown. The internet that was once an open space for freedom, sharing and exploration isn't what it used to be anymore. It's has became a place for data harvesting, targeted ads and constant surveillance. The more i found out how it all works, the more i wanted to protect my own data and also help others do the same. With that said, that's how my privacy journey began.</p><h3>Digital Minimalism to Privacy Advocate</h3><h6>Minimalism</h6><p>A few years ago, I noticed that I spent hours just playing mindless games on my mobile phone, doom scrolling social media and checking my notifications very few minutes. I decided it was time to try out digital minimalism for a few months. I challenged myself to remove unnecessary distractions, which meant deactivating the few social media accounts I used only keeping Instragram to connect with friends and to occasionally see what they're up to. No more than 1 hour of use per day.</p><p>Doing this, I have actually freed up time and space for deeper and more meaningful interactions with technology and even the people around me. What I thought was an experiment for a few months lasted longer than expected. I never went back to social media again.</p><p>Sidenote: Now that I use my mobile phone less, I notice how much people are using theirs during dinners and meet-ups, it's <strong>FUCKING</strong> annoying. Might as well just hangout on Discord.</p><h6>Privacy Advocate</h6><p>During my digital minimalism journey, I also realized how much information and data we give away without thinking about it. From sharing everything we do to tracking cookies to social media surveillance. The technology that I once loved for connecting has evolved into exploiting us. We have became the product of these mega corporations, profiting off our data.</p><p>That was when I decided to dive into the world of privacy advocacy, learning about data encryption, VPN's and opensource tools that would help secure my data and minimize my digital footprint. This lead me to moving away from big tech such as Google, Amazon &amp; Microsoft etc. Obviously, there is no way to 100% avoid them, but it'll try my best to minimize contact. That's also the driving reason I have moved away from Windows and made Linux my main OS.</p><h3>Making the Switch</h3><p>I was lucky to have started tinkering with Linux since the early stages so I have some knowledge, making the learning curve less steep. However, Linux today is far more user friendly, it might even be easier to use than Windows now.</p><p>For over a decade, I have always kept Linux with me in a dual-boot configuration but it was always my secondary OS. As I started to embrace privacy more fully, I realized that Windows no longer align with my values. It's time to make Linux my primary OS and Windows my second boot option.</p><p>Why not just remove Windows completely? </p><p>The only reason I still keep Windows around is for gaming. Many games with strong anti cheat does not support Linux. So, I only boot into Windows then I needa game.</p><h3>Why Linux?</h3><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.alaskantf.com/media/posts/15/Screenshot_20250821_201237.png" alt="My Fedora KDE Desktop" width="1920" height="1080" sizes="(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)" srcset="https://blog.alaskantf.com/media/posts/15/responsive/Screenshot_20250821_201237-xs.png 300w, https://blog.alaskantf.com/media/posts/15/responsive/Screenshot_20250821_201237-sm.png 480w, https://blog.alaskantf.com/media/posts/15/responsive/Screenshot_20250821_201237-md.png 768w, https://blog.alaskantf.com/media/posts/15/responsive/Screenshot_20250821_201237-lg.png 1024w"><figcaption>My Fedora KDE Desktop</figcaption></figure><p>As a privacy advocate, I now value privacy, autonomy and control over my data and digital life.

Ultimately, I have chosen to settle down with Fedora KDE as it aligns with my values</p><p>Fedora KDE being opensource means I have full control over my system and security. I can see what's happening under the hood, no surveillance or data collection.
