It's more of a process that requires continuous and consistent effort, regular adjustments, and a willingness to evaluate your online habits. As technology evolves, so do the methods of surveillance and data harvesting, meaning the steps we take today may not be enough tomorrow. Thus, I say protecting your privacy is a continuous process that requires consistency. We must learn, adapt, and refine strategies to keep up with the ever changing landscape of privacy.</p><p>Before we dive into the specific tools I use</p><p class="msg msg--warning"><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong><br>I am not a privacy professional. What works for me may not work for you, as each person's privacy needs are different depending on their threat model. For example, whistleblowers and journalists require a much higher level of privacy compared to someone who's just trying to hide their browsing habits or prevent large corporations from harvesting their data. Everyone's threat model is unique, so you will need to find the balance between privacy and convenience that works for you.</p><h3>My Threat Model</h3><p>Before starting your privacy journey, it's important to understand your threat model. To provide context for the tools and steps I use, here's an overview of my own threat model:</p><ul><li><strong>What do I want to protect?</strong><ul><li>I am focused on protecting my personal data, such as browsing habits, communications, and sensitive information like passwords and health reports.<br><br></li></ul></li><li><strong>Who do I want to protect it from?</strong><ul><li>Primarily, I want to protect myself from large corporations, surveillance, advertising networks, and data brokers. Additionally, I want to prevent data breaches from governments or corporations that may track my online behavior for political or commercial purposes.<br><br></li></ul></li><li><strong>How likely is it that I will need to protect it?</strong><ul><li>I’m not dealing with high-risk threats like journalists or whistleblowers might face, but the amount of data being harvested and used for surveillance is enough to justify making some changes in my daily life.<br><br></li></ul></li><li><strong>How bad are the consequences if I fail?</strong><ul><li>Failing to protect my privacy could lead to identity theft, loss of personal data, and manipulation (e.g., targeted ads, price manipulation). While these risks are manageable, I want to avoid them as much as possible.<br><br></li></ul></li><li><strong>How much trouble am I willing to go through to try to prevent potential consequences?</strong><ul><li>I’m willing to put in consistent effort to protect my privacy. This means using privacy tools, privacy respecting applications, and sacrificing some convenience to reduce my digital footprint. However, it's all about balance, I'm not trying to reach a state of paranoia or extreme measures.</li></ul></li></ul><p>You can read more about threat models here: <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/en/basics/threat-modeling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Threat Modeling: The First Step on Your Privacy Journey</a></p><h3>Privacy Tools I Use</h3><p>Now that we have an understanding of my threat model, let's take a look at the specific tools I use to protect my privacy. These tools help keep my data secure without compromising too much on convenience:</p><ul><li><strong>Operating System: <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fedora 42 KDE</a> (instead of Windows)</strong><ul><li>I made a previous post about it. check it out <a href="https://blog.alaskantf.com/why-linux-is-my-daily-driver-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE</a>.<br><br></li></ul></li><li><strong>Browser: <a href="https://www.firefox.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox</a> with Privacy Extensions (instead of Chrome)</strong><br>The browser is one of the most important tools for privacy, as it's where I (and everyone) spend most of their online time.<br><br><ul><li><strong>Privacy Extensions</strong><ul><li><strong>uBlock Origin</strong><br>A must have for blocking ads, trackers, and other unwanted content. It’s an effective and lightweight ad blocker that doesn’t compromise browsing speed.<br><br></li><li><strong>Decentraleyes</strong><br>This extension reduces the reliance on third party servers by locally hosting common web assets like JavaScript libraries. This minimizes the amount of data shared with third-party websites.<br><br></li><li><strong>LocalCDN</strong><br>This extension serves common web resources locally, reducing the dependency on external content delivery networks (CDNs) that can track you across sites. It improves both privacy and performance.<br><br></li><li><strong>Disable WebRTC</strong><br>WebRTC is a protocol for real time communication but can leak your true IP address, even when using a VPN. This extension ensures WebRTC is disabled, preventing that data leak.<br><br></li><li><strong>Cookie AutoDelete</strong><br>This extension automatically deletes cookies when you close a tab, helping to minimize tracking from websites. It’s useful for keeping your browsing habits private.<br><br></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong><a href="https://nordvpn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VPN: NordVPN</a></strong><br>NordVPN encrypts my internet traffic and routes it through a server, hiding my real IP address. It’s crucial for preventing surveillance and maintaining anonymity, especially when using public WiFi networks.<br><br></li><li><strong>Password Manager: <a href="https://nordpass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NordPass</a> &amp; <a href="https://keepassxc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KeePassXC</a> (instead of Google/Apple/Samsung password manager)</strong><br>NordPass is used for securely managing my online passwords, while KeePassXC is my offline, self hosted password manager for sensitive information.<br><br></li><li><strong>Cloud: Self-hosted NAS at Home (instead of Google Drive/OneDrive/Apple Cloud)</strong><br>Instead of relying on third-party cloud services, I use a self-hosted NAS (Network-Attached Storage) system at home. This gives me full control over my data storage and eliminates privacy risks associated with external providers.<br><br></li><li><strong><a href="https://proton.me/mail" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Email Provider: ProtonMail</a> (instead of Gmail/Hotmail)</strong><br>ProtonMail is a privacy focused email provider that offers end-to-end encryption (E2EE) and a no logs policy. It’s based in Switzerland, known for its strong privacy laws.<br><br></li><li><strong><a href="https://duckduckgo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Search Engine: DuckDuckGo</a> (instead of Google)</strong><br>DuckDuckGo doesn’t track or store your search history. It’s a great alternative to Google, which profiles you based on your search activity.<br><br></li><li><strong><a href="https://getaegis.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2FA Manager: Aegis Authenticator</a> (instead of Google Authenticator/Authy)</strong><br>Aegis is an open-source two-factor authentication (2FA) codes manager. I use it to secure my online accounts by adding an additional layer of protection beyond just passwords.</li></ul><h3>Steps I Take Beyond Tools and Applications</h3><ol><li><strong>Limit Social Media</strong><br>I minimize my social media presence and avoid sharing unnecessary personal information online.<br><br></li><li><strong>Regular Privacy Checks</strong><br>I regularly review privacy settings on my accounts and make sure I’m aware of any changes in policies or tracking mechanisms.<br><br></li><li><strong>Use Aliases or Disposable Emails</strong><br>I use disposable email addresses for one-time sign-ups to avoid giving out my main email and aliases for sign-us that things that are not important but I will probably return to use.<br><br></li><li><strong>Use Strong Passwords &amp; 2FA</strong><br>Strong passwords and two-factor authentication are essential for keeping my online accounts secure. I do not have a single repeated password.<br><br></li><li><strong>Monitor Data Breaches</strong><br>I use services like "Have I Been Pwned" to check if my information has been compromised in any data breaches. Protonmail and NordVPN automatically checks and informs we if any of my email address/password has been detected in data breaches.</li></ol><p>These are just some of the steps I have taken that isn't too much of an inconvenience for me to keep my privacy and data secure.</p><p>Do let me know if you have any questions or have any suggestions :D </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on September 20, 2025</p><div class="post__share"></div></footer><nav class="pagination"><div class="pagination__title"><span>Read other posts</span></div><div class="pagination__buttons"><a href="https://blog.alaskantf.com/why-linux-is-my-daily-driver-now/" class="btn previous" rel="prev" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  Why Linux is My Daily Driver Now "><span class="btn__icon">←</span> <span class="btn__text">Why Linux is My Daily Driver Now</span> </a><a href="https://blog.alaskantf.com/about-my-portfolio-plebs-capital/" class="btn next" rel="next" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  About My Portfolio (Plebs Capital) "><span class="btn__text">About My Portfolio (Plebs Capital)</span> <span class="btn__icon">→</span></a></div></nav></article><div class="post__comments"></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__inner"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>© 2025 Powered by Publii CMS</p></div></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.alaskantf.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=c2232aa7558e9517946129d2a1b8c770"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
